# Golden Age of Video Games Data Analysis Through SQL

* Video games have exploded into a massive industry, with forecasts suggesting the global gaming market will exceed $300 billion by 2027, according to Mordor Intelligence. With such substantial financial stakes, major game publishers are highly incentivized to produce the next blockbuster. However, amidst this fierce competition, one crucial question persists: Are games improving, or have we already experienced the pinnacle of video gaming's golden era?
* In this analysis I explored video game data from 1977-2020 by utilizing advanced SQL techniques such as table joins, filtering, set theory, and subqueries to delve deep into the history of video games. The original data tables included over 13,000 games but was reduced to focus on the top 400 best selling videogames over this time period.
