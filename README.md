# Golden Age of Video Games Data Analysis Through SQL

* Video games have exploded into a massive industry, with forecasts suggesting the global gaming market will exceed $300 billion by 2027, according to Mordor Intelligence. With such substantial financial stakes, major game publishers are highly incentivized to produce the next blockbuster. However, amidst this fierce competition, one crucial question persists: Are games improving, or have we already experienced the pinnacle of video gaming's golden era?
* In this analysis I explored video game data from 1977-2020 by utilizing advanced SQL techniques such as table joins, filtering, set theory, and subqueries to delve deep into the history of video games. The original data tables game_sales and game_reviews included over 13,000 games but was reduced to focus on the top 400 best selling videogames over this time period.

* Determing the golden age of video games is very subjective depending on what your genre of choice is and how you want to look at the data. I decided to be as unbiased as posible and stricly looked at data collected from critic scores, user/player scores, and games sold during the year the game launched. As we all know how critics score video games and how players score video games can vary greatley, I had to take this into account. 

# Summary
